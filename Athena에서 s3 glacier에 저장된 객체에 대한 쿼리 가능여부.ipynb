    "According to official documentation [1], Athena does not support querying the data in the GLACIER storage class. Also as you might know, when you restore a glacier object, Amazon S3 restores a temporary copy of the object only for the specified duration. \n",
    "\n",
    "After that, it deletes the restored object copy [2]. This means even if the object has been restored from Glacier and can be accessible in real time, the object is still in Glacier storage class. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to make Athena query work with the GLACIER objects, please transition the object back to the Amazon S3 Standard storage class. You will need to first restore each object individually, and then change the storage class to 'Standard' by running a copy operation either by overwriting the existing object or copying the object into another location [3]. Please see the section \"Change the object's storage class to Amazon S3 Standard\" in documentation link [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if the object was restored successfully or not and its storage class, please use the command below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ aws s3api head-object --bucket abcde --key objectname\n",
